PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This project is a case-tracking and provider-management system designed specifically for personal injury law firms. The application streamlines collaboration between legal teams, medical providers, and marketing teams by centralizing client treatment data, case progress, provider performance, and communication records.

The system is intended for mid-sized personal injury firms that currently rely on spreadsheets or manual tracking to make decisions. By digitizing the workflow, the tool helps attorneys and case managers monitor client treatment timelines, ensures medical providers receive timely updates, and gives marketing teams insights into which providers are delivering the best client outcomes.
